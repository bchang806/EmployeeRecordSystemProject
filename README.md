# EmployeeRecordSystemProject

The Employee Record System is used to add, remove, update, check, show employees in the company.

The purpose of this project is to illustrate the OOPs concepts

The skills I applied:

A List of Employee objects is used to store each employee as an object.
Encapsulation is used in the Employee class to get and set private data in Employee Class.
Inheritance is used for different job title classes to inherit "Employee" class.
Polymorphism is used for different job title classes to have its own bonus rate and title, but they are all Employee objects.
The infinite while loop is used to always show the menu if the user does not enter the specific value to exit.
The switch statement is used to execute the option that the user selected.
The for loop is used to search for the employee if his or her first name and last name are a match to the input from the user.
